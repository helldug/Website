    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): </h1>
     
    <h2>1: Why what this product line made? </h2>
    <p class="Faq"> This product line was made so that more durable razer gear can be sold. Razer does not condone raging at video games and taking it out on your hardware, and the intention is not for the gear to survive getting beaten up but instead lasting for a longer period of time under the same conditions that normal hardware would face on a daily basis. </p>
    
    <h2>2: What will be the prices of the new Rage Mode Gear?</h2>
    <p> We are aiming for prices between the chroma series gear and the non RGB gear, so for example the 'Razer Nari' with Chroma compatibility is £149 and the essential version is £99.99. Our Rage mode version will be £129.99 at release As it features a more durable material and also red LED's. </p>
    
    <h2>1: What program did you use to construct the website?</h2>
    <p> I used the program known as brackets to construct the website. </p>
